2,Helium,He,"Named after the Greek ἥλιος (*helios*), which means ""the sun"" or the mythological sun-god.[18] It was first identified by its characteristic emission lines in the Sun's spectrum."
3,Lithium,Li,"From Greek λίθος (*lithos*) ""stone"", because it was discovered from a mineral while other common alkali metals (sodium and potassium) were discovered from plant tissue."
4,Beryllium,Be,"βήρυλλος *beryllos*, denoting beryl, which contains beryllium.[9] The word is derived (via Latin: beryllus and French: béryl) from the Greek *βήρυλλος*, *bērullos*, *a blue-green spar*, from Prakrit *veruliya* (वॆरुलिय‌), from Pāli *veḷuriya* (वेलुरिय); *veḷiru* (भेलिरु) or, *viḷar* (भिलर्), ""to become pale,"" in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl.[10] The word is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word वैडूर्य vaidurya, which might be related to the name of the Indian city of Belur.[11]"
5,Boron,B,"From the Arabic بورق (*buraq*), which refers to borax. Possibly derived from the Persian, بوره (*burah*). The Arabic was adapted as Medieval Latin *baurach,* Anglo-Norman *boreis,* and Middle English *boras,* which became the source of the English ""boron""."
6,Carbon,C,"From the French, *charbone*, which in turn came from Latin *carbō*, which means ""charcoal"" and is related to *carbōn*, which means ""a coal"". (The German and Dutch names, ""Kohlenstoff"" and ""koolstof"", respectively, both literally mean ""coal matter"".) These words were derived from the PIE base **ker-* meaning *heat,* *fire,* or *to burn.*[17]"
7,Nitrogen,N,"From French ""nitrogène"",[37] derived from Greek νίτρον γείνομαι (*nitron geinomai*), meaning ""I form/beget native-soda (niter)"".[38]Also used was *azoth*, from Andalusian Arabic *al-zuq*, from the Classical Arabic name of the element."
8,Oxygen,O,"From Greek ὀξύ γείνομαι (*oxy geinomai*), which means ""Ι bring forth acid"", as it was believed to be an essential component of acids. This phrase was corrupted into the French *oxygène*, which became the source of the English ""oxygen"".[39]"

10,Neon,Ne,"From Greek ""νέος"" (*neos*), which means ""new""."
11,Sodium,Na,"From the English ""soda"", used in names for sodium compounds such as caustic soda, soda ash, and baking soda. Probably from Italian *sida* (or directly from Medieval Latin *soda*) ""a kind of saltwort,"" from which soda was obtained, of uncertain origin.[53] The symbol *Na* is from the Modern Latin noun *natrium*, derived from Greek νίτρον (nítron), ""natural soda, a kind of salt"" + Latin *-ium*.[54] The original source is either the Arabic word نطرون *natrun* or the Egyptian word [TABLE] *netjeri.*[55]"
12,Magnesium,Mg,"From the Ancient Greek Μαγνησία (Magnesia) (district in Thessaly), where discovered."
13,Aluminium,Al,"Latin *alumen*, which means ""alum"" (literally ""bitter salt"")."

22,Titanium,Ti,"For the ""Titans"", the first sons of Gaia in Greek mythology.[18]"
23,Vanadium,V,"From *Vanadís*, one of the names of the Vanr goddess Freyja in Norse mythology, because of multicoloured chemical compounds deemed beautiful.[18]"
24,Chromium,Cr,"From Greek χρῶμα (*chróma*), ""colour"", because of its multicoloured compounds. This word was adapted as the French *chrome*, and adding the suffix -*ium* created the English ""chromium"".[22]"
25,Manganese,Mn,"From Latin *Magnesia*, ultimately from Greek; Magnesia evolved into ""manganese"" in Italian and into ""manganèse"" in French."
26,Iron,Fe,"From the Anglo-Saxon *īsern* which is derived from Proto-Germanic *isarnan* meaning ""holy metal"" or ""strong metal"".The symbol *Fe* is from Latin *ferrum*, meaning ""iron""."
27,Cobalt,Co,"From German *Kobold*, which means ""evil spirit"". The metal was named by miners, because it was poisonous and troublesome (polluted and degraded other mined elements, such as nickel). Other sources cite the origin in the silver miners' belief that cobalt had been placed by ""Kobolds"", who had stolen the silver. Some also think that the name may have been derived from Greek κόβαλος, *kobalos*, which means ""mine"" and which may have common roots with kobold, goblin, and cobalt."
28,Nickel,Ni,"From the Swedish *kopparnickel*, meaning ""copper-coloured ore""; this referred to the ore niccolite from which it was obtained.[36]"
29,Copper,Cu,"Possibly derived from Greek Κύπριος (*Kyprios*) (which comes from Κύπρος (*Kypros*), the Greek name of Cyprus) via Latin *cuprum*, West Germanic **kupar*, Old English *coper*/*copor*, and Middle English *coper*. The Latin term, during the Roman Empire, was *aes cyprium*; ""aes"" was the generic term for copper alloys such as bronze). *Cyprium* means ""Cyprus"" or ""which is from Cyprus"", where so much of it was mined; it was simplified to *cuprum* and then eventually Anglicized as *copper* (Old English *coper/copor*)."
